# Step 1: the core

The plan for step 1 of the order of work ([TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md](../design/TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md), section 12). It is cut into slices so that each one can be handed to an agent, reviewed, and committed before the next starts. A slice's brief is written in full here before it is delegated; later slices stay outlines until then, so they can absorb what the earlier ones teach.

## Goal

The core of fullmark 1.0 and the commands that need no page: `check`, `rules`, `grade` and `ids`.

**Done when** every example passes `check`; the grading cases from 0.x pass as vitest tests against the 1.0 grader; and `check`, `rules`, `grade` and `ids` match reviewed golden files (exit codes, messages, `--json` lines), for one file and for several, including three quizzes of which one is broken.

**Not in step 1:** `build`. It moved to step 2, with the page runtime it needs; a step 1 `build` would produce placeholder pages whose golden files step 2 would replace.

## Rules for every slice

- **Read first:** [QUIZ_SYNTAX.md](../design/QUIZ_SYNTAX.md), [TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md](../design/TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md) (sections 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9 and 11) and [COMMANDS.md](../design/COMMANDS.md) (Conventions, and the commands the slice touches). The design docs win over this plan; if they disagree or leave a gap, stop and report it rather than invent an answer.
- **Stack:** TypeScript (strict), Node 22 or later (the machine runs 24), **npm** with a committed `package-lock.json`, tsup for the CLI bundle, vitest, Biome. Dependencies only from TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md section 3, pinned exactly; add one only when its slice needs it.
- **Layout:** `src/` as in TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md section 7. `src/core` imports no `node:*` module and nothing from `library`; a test enforces it.
- **Determinism:** no `Date.now()`, `Math.random()`, OS locale or `Intl` in `core`. Sorting uses a fixed comparison.
- **Tests:** every behaviour has a vitest test. Test data lives in `test/`.
- **Git:** work on branch `1.0`. Small commits, each with a message saying what and why, ending with `Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 5.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>`. Never push.
- **Report:** commits (hashes), test counts, every gap or contradiction found in the design docs, and anything decided differently, with the reason.

## Slices

| Slice | Content | Done when |
|---|---|---|
| **1a** | Scaffold, and step 0's test data ported to the 1.0 syntax | below |
| **1b** | Parser: Markdown and YAML to the IR, with positions, ids, slugs and hash normalisation; the syntax rules of QUIZ_SYNTAX.md section 8a; `quiz ids` | every example and valid fixture parses; every invalid fixture gives exactly its expected rule ids and lines; `quiz ids` contract tests |
| **1c** | Rule registry, quality rules, `fullmark.toml` and profiles, custom checks, inline ignores, message catalogs for what pages and reports show; `check` and `rules` | every rule has a fixture that triggers it and one that does not, under each built-in profile; config errors point to `file:line` |
| **1d** | Plan and Attempt, `results-v2`, the grader, rubric modes and presets, `grades-v2`, reports; `grade` | the 0.x grading cases pass; rubric golden cases, IELTS rounding edges included; a `grades-v1` file is refused |
| **1e** | Contract tests across the commands: golden files, several files, `--json` lines, exit codes, the startup budget | the step's done criteria above |

## Slice 1a: scaffold and test data

### Scaffold

1. **Package.** `package.json`: name `fullmark`, version `1.0.0-alpha.0`, `"type": "module"`, `engines.node` `>=22`, bins `quiz` and `fullmark` pointing at `dist/cli.js`. Scripts: `build` (tsup), `test` (vitest run), `typecheck` (`tsc --noEmit`), `lint` (`biome check`), and `check` running typecheck, lint and test.
2. **Dependencies for 1a only:** `typescript`, `tsup`, `vitest`, `@biomejs/biome` (dev), and `commander`. Pinned exact versions.
3. **TypeScript:** strict, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, ES2023 target, bundler module resolution.
4. **Biome:** replace the 0.x leftover `biome.json` (it points at `src/fullmark/static`) with one for `src/**`, `test/**` and the config files, keeping the formatter settings (2 spaces, width 120, LF).
5. **Layout:** create `src/core/`, `src/cli/` and `test/`. Create the other folders of TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md section 7 only when a slice fills them.
6. **CLI skeleton:** `src/cli/main.ts` with commander. `quiz --version` prints `fullmark 1.0.0-alpha.0`; `quiz --help` lists no commands yet. An `exit-codes.ts` with the four codes of COMMANDS.md (Conventions). The bundle is one file with a shebang.
7. **Message catalogs:** `src/core/i18n/` with `en.ts` as the source, `vi.ts` typed `satisfies Messages`, and one key each, so a missing key is a compile error from the first commit. Terminal output is English and does not use the catalogs (TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md, section 9).
8. **Boundary test:** a vitest test that fails when any file under `src/core` imports `node:*` or anything under `src/library`.
9. `.gitignore`: add `node_modules/`.
10. Tests: `--version` through the built bundle; the boundary test; the catalog compiles.

### Test data from 0.x

The source is `D:\coding-projects\fullmark-py` (0.10.3, read only). Every quiz is rewritten in the 1.0 syntax by hand, following QUIZ_SYNTAX.md section 11 (changes from 0.10.2). The main changes: `type=` on every question; a readable `id=` on every question; `::: hint` and `::: explanation`; `kind:` for `mode:`; `partial:` for `multi_scoring:`; `pick` only on sections; `source=` for `Source:` notes; `sample_answer` for code's `reference`, and no `show_*` keys; rubrics in the 1.0 form (the IELTS example uses `preset:`); field points absolute.

| From (fullmark-py) | To (fullmark-1.0) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `src/fullmark/examples/*.md` except `blank.md`, with `assets/` | `examples/<name>/quiz.md` and `examples/<name>/assets/` | six examples; `examples/` at the 0.x root holds the same quizzes |
| `src/fullmark/examples/blank.md` | `templates/blank/quiz.md` | the template `quiz new` will copy (step 3) |
| `tests/fixtures/*.md` and `assets/` | `test/fixtures/valid/` | |
| `tests/fixtures/invalid/*.md` | `test/fixtures/invalid/` | with a new `expected.json`: for each file, the 1.0 rule id from QUIZ_SYNTAX.md section 8a and the line |
| `tests/grading_cases.json` | `test/data/grading_cases.json` | copied unchanged |

- **Invalid fixtures:** each one must still break exactly one rule of section 8a. A fixture whose 0.x error no longer exists in 1.0 (for example because 1.0 allows it) is dropped and listed in the report. A 0.x error with no 1.0 rule is a gap in section 8a: keep the fixture, mark it `"rule": null`, and list it. Add a fixture for each rule of section 8a that has none, so every syntax rule has one.
- **Grading cases:** the file keeps 0.x's shape until slice 1d defines `results-v2` answers. Add `test/grading-cases.test.ts`, which loads the file and registers each case as `it.todo` with its name, so the 160 cases are visible from now on.
- **Valid data:** nothing can parse it until 1b. Check it by reading against QUIZ_SYNTAX.md; 1b's done criteria prove it.

### Done when

`npm run check` passes; `node dist/cli.js --version` prints `fullmark 1.0.0-alpha.0`; the examples, the template and the fixtures are in place in the 1.0 syntax; `expected.json` covers every invalid fixture; and the report lists the dropped fixtures, the rules with no fixture before, and every gap found in the design docs.
